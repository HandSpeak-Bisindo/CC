# HandSpeak Backend
This repository contains code that utilizes various technologies for a specific application. The technologies used in this code are as follows:

## Technologies Used
### -Node.js : 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a server-side environment for running JavaScript applications.
### -TensorFlow.js : 
TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for machine learning in the browser and on Node.js. It allows you to build and train machine learning models using JavaScript and perform predictions using TensorFlow.
### -JWT (JSON Web Tokens): 
JWT is a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications. JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.
### -Sequelize: 
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js. It provides an easy way to interact with relational databases by abstracting the underlying SQL queries.
### -Bcrypt : 
Bcrypt is a library used for password hashing. It provides a secure way to store user passwords by encrypting them using a hashing algorithm.
### -Google Cloud Storage : 
Google Cloud Storage is a scalable object storage service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It allows you to store and retrieve data in a highly available and durable manner.
### -Sharp : 
Sharp is a high-performance image processing library for Node.js. It provides features like resizing, cropping, and applying filters to images.
### -Jimp : 
Jimp is an image processing library for Node.js. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for manipulating images, including resizing, cropping, and applying various effects.
